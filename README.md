# Simple C Web Server

A lightweight web server written in C, built from scratch to understand how networking and HTTP works at a low level.

## Roadmap / To-Do List

1. **Basic Server**

   * Create a simple TCP server that listens on a port.
   * Respond with a fixed static response (e.g., "Hello, World!").

2. **Serve Static Files & Logging**

   * Add ability to serve static files (HTML, CSS, images).
   * Implement a basic logging system to track requests and responses.

3. **Multi-Threading Support**

   * Enable the server to handle multiple clients concurrently using threads or worker processes.

4. **Security & HTTPS**

   * Add basic security checks and input validation.
   * Implement TLS/SSL support for HTTPS.

**I am Not Sure if i can make this ðŸ™‚**

5. **Dynamic Content (PHP Support)**

   * Integrate with a PHP interpreter to handle dynamic web pages.
   * Support executing PHP scripts and returning the output.

6. **Proxy Features**

   * Add reverse proxy capabilities to forward requests to other applications (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).

## Future Enhancements

* Add caching.
* Add configuration files.
* Support HTTP/2.
